### FJC Data

----- 

This package contains a data set of federal judge biographies. 

The individual biographies are availabe from the Federal Judicial Center at https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges. 

The data set consists of a row for each judge/court combination along with certain key dates (dates of termination, dates for entering senior status). 

I may try to add some other small federal courts data sets here as I find them.
